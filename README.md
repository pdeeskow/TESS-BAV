The repository shows three Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the usage of the lightkurve library to analyse variable stars in the TESS data archiv.
The file tess_lightcurve.ipynb demonstrates the usages of pipeline generated lightcurves and the applicatoin of periodograms.
In tess_tpf.ipynb the handling of target pixel files is explained.
tess_cut.ipynb demonstrates the usage of tess_cut to extract targets from the full frame images of TESS.

This research made use of Lightkurve, a Python package for Kepler and TESS data analysis (Lightkurve Collaboration, 2018).
